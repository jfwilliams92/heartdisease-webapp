cp: chest pain type
-- Value 0: asymptomatic
-- Value 1: atypical angina
-- Value 2: non-anginal pain
-- Value 3: typical angina

restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
-- Value 0: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
-- Value 1: normal
-- Value 2: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping

thal: 1 = fixed defect; 2 = normal; 7 = reversable defect

target (maybe THE most important feature): 0 = disease, 1 = no disease

A few more things to consider:
data #93, 139, 164, 165 and 252 have ca=4 which is incorrect. In the original Cleveland dataset they are NaNs (so they should be removed)
data #49 and 282 have thal = 0, also incorrect. They are also NaNs in the original dataset.

I'll copy a sentence so you get more insight about the "thal" column (thal is for Thalium, a radioactive tracer injected during a stress test):
--Nuclear stress testing requires the injection of a tracer, commonly technicium 99M (Myoview or Cardiolyte), which is then taken up by healthy, viable myocardial cells. A camera (detector) is used afterwards to image the heart and compare segments. A coronary stenosis is detected when a myocardial segment takes up the nuclear tracer at rest, but not during cardiac stress. This is called a "reversible defect." Scarred myocardium from prior infarct will not take up tracer at all and is referred to as a "fixed defect." --
